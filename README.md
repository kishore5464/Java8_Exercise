Java 8:
-------
   Trying to understand more in Java 8 in-build methods which we can use for our operations.

String:
-------
1. One Occurrence Characters (Printing Duplicate as well as Non-Duplicate Characters)
2. Print only duplicate Character only once
3. Sorting Characters in Ascending and Descending Orders
4. Converting Characters to UPPERCASE and lowercase
5. Increment and Decrement each Character to its Next & Previous Character (e.g. If we have 'A' need to increment to 'B')
