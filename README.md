Java 8:
-------
   Trying to understand more in Java 8 in-build methods which we can use for our operations.

String:
-------
1. One Occurrence Characters
2. Need to print only duplicate once
3. Sort Characters in Asc and Des Orders
4. Convert all Characters to UPPERCASE and lowercase
5. Increment and Decrement each Character to its Next Character (e.g. If we have 'A' need to increment to 'B')
